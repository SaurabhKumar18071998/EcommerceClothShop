## Project Overview
This backend server provides the necessary APIs and functionalities to support the frontend of the MERN Stack E-commerce Cloth Shop Project. It handles tasks such as user authentication, product management, order processing, and more.

## Features
- RESTful API endpoints for user authentication, product management, order processing, etc.
- Integration with MongoDB for data storage
- Authentication middleware using Passport.js
- Payment processing integration (e.g., Stripe)
- Email notification functionalities (e.g., order confirmation, password reset)

## Technical Stack
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose ORM
- Passport.js for authentication
- Integration with third-party services (e.g., Stripe for payments, Nodemailer for emails)

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- MongoDB installed and running on your local machine or accessible via a remote connection.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
- git clone https://github.com/saurabhkumarv/Saurabh-Kumar-MERN-Ecommerce-backend.git

2. Navigate to the project directory.
- cd Saurabh-Kumar-MERN-Ecommerce-backend

3. Install dependencies.
- npm install


## Configuration
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Define environment variables such as MongoDB connection URI, secret keys for authentication, SMTP server settings for email notifications, etc., in the `.env` file. You can refer to the `.env.example` file for an example.

## Running the Server
1. Start the backend server.
- node index.js

This will start the server on the specified port (default is 8080) and connect to the MongoDB database.

2. You should see a message indicating that the server is running and connected to the database.

## Usage
1. Once the server is running, you can use tools like Postman or your frontend application to interact with the API endpoints exposed by the server.
2. Refer to the API documentation or codebase for details on available endpoints and their usage.

That's it! You have successfully set up and run the backend server for the MERN Stack E-commerce Cloth Shop Project. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to contact saurabhkumar18071998@gmail.com for assistance.
